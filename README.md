# Slick Game of Life
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Java using Slick2D and lwjgl v2.

## Building
This source code was built in [Eclipse (Mars)](https://www.eclipse.org/) using [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com) and the [lwjgl v2](http://www.lwjgl.org/). To produce the finished application, you will need to add Slick2D as a library to your build path, which will necessitate downloading the native libraries for lwjgl and pointing to those for Slick's native library location.

In general, you can use the tutorials found on Slick2D's site to set up a project using Slick and lwjgl.

Once the project is set up, simply import the code into Eclipse and build and run it. No further configuration is necessary.

## Purpose
I'm not trying to do anything particularly new or spectacular. I've just never actually implemented Conway's Game of Life before, so I figured why not?
